A game about a bunny stuck in a looping labyrinth

## Is this game open source?
**No.** In contrast to [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), this game is only [source available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software). **Not having a licence means that by default we reserve all original rights for the game, even if the code is public.**  

However, we are very lax with what you can do with the source code. This is just to legally cover our asses from abusers. 

### Examples of things that ARE okay:
- Reusing some sprites or small bits of code (functions, classes, Godot nodes...) in your games, even commercial, and crediting us.
- Forking this repo and making your own mods, as long as you are not profiting from them.

### Examples of things that are NOT okay:
- Taking any pre-existing or self-built executables, with no or minor modifications, or a major part of the source code, and reuploading it to other places, whether you are directly or indirectly profiting from it or not.
- We just don't like what you are doing. (e.g., AI-powered NFT crypto trading cards)
